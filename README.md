# uCAD
the uCAD fiat token

# Setup
Tests need node v8.0.0 or higher, as they depend on async/await functionality. Interacting with eth is very async-y so await makes it much easier to write tests.
Depends on truffle and testrpc for testing.

install truffle:
```npm install -g truffle```

install ganache-cli:
```npm install -g ganache-cli```

install project npm dependencies:
```npm install```

# Testing
All tests are run with:
```npm run truffle-test```

or run a specific file of tests with:
```npm run truffle-test -- [file]```

to generate test coverage on all tests run:
```npm test```


# Contracts
The implementation uses 2 separate contracts - a proxy contract (`FiatTokenProxy.sol`)and an implementation contract(`FiatToken.sol`).
This allows upgrading the contract, as a new implementation contact can be deployed and the Proxy updated to point to it.
## FiatToken
The FiatToken offers a number of capabilities, which briefly are described below. There are more
[detailed design docs](./doc/tokendesign.md) in the `doc` folder.

### ERC20 compatible
The FiatToken implements the ERC20 interface.

### Pausable
The entire contract can be frozen, in case a serious bug is found or there is a serious key compromise. No transfers can take place while the contract is paused.
Access to the pause functionality is controlled by the `pauser` address.

### Upgradable
A new implementation contract can be deployed, and the proxy contract will forward calls to the new contract.
Access to the upgrade functionality is guarded by a `proxyOwner` address. Only the `proxyOwner` address can change the `proxyOwner` address.

### Blacklist
The contract can blacklist certain addresses which will prevent those addresses from transferring or receiving tokens.
Access to the blacklist functionality is controlled by the `blacklister` address.

### Minting/Burning
Tokens can be minted or burned on demand. The contract supports having multiple minters simultaneously. There is a
`masterMinter` address which controls the list of minters and how much each is allowed to mint. The mint allowance is
similar to the ERC20 allowance - as each minter mints new tokens their allowance decreases. When it gets too low they will
need the allowance increased again by the `masterMinter`.

### Ownable
The contract has an Owner, who can change the `owner`, `pauser`, `blacklister`, or `masterMinter` addresses. The `owner` can not change
the `proxyOwner` address.
